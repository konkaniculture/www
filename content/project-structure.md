With the advent of cloud machine learning systems, it is proposed to use these technologies to assist and speed up the work associated with the main goals.

* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of any Konkani dialect script (Kannada, Roman, Marathi) text into its Unicode text form.
* Translate any Konkani dialect in Unicode Form into English and vice-versa. (requires grammar analysis)
* Create a audio reader for text in any dialect.
* Voice recognition (realtime or audio file) of Konkani dialects into English.
* Audio translation for videos to Unicode Form.
* Subtitle generation for videos.
* Use these systems for people to learn Konkani language and its dialects.

Since we have larger goals, proposed technical choices:

* PRINCE2 methodology for managing projects.
* github.com for technology projects management
* bitbucket.org for main project documentation
* tesseract-ocr for optical character recognition
* kaldi-asr for automatic speech recognition
